# TicketRush Simulation System

## Overview
TicketRush is a simulation system designed for the production and consumption of tickets, tracking logs, and managing multiple simulations. This system is built as part of an **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Assignment**. The project integrates a robust backend developed with Java Spring Boot and an interactive frontend built with Angular.

## Backend Setup (Spring Boot)

### Prerequisites
Ensure the following tools are installed on your system:
- [Java 17+](https://openjdk.java.net/) (JDK 17 or higher)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) for dependency management
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) for the database

### Running the Backend
1. Navigate to the `backend/` directory.
2. Ensure your MySQL database is running. Use the following configuration in your `application.properties`:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/eventpulse_db
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=root
```

3. Build and run the Spring Boot application using Maven:

```bash
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

4. The backend server will start on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

### API Endpoints
- **POST /start-simulation**: Start a new ticket simulation.
- **GET /fetch-simulation-id**: Fetch the current simulation ID.
- **GET /fetch-logs/{simulationId}**: Fetch logs for a specific simulation.
- **GET /fetch-all-simulation-ids**: Fetch all simulation IDs.

### Database Schema
Ensure your MySQL database includes the following tables:
- **Ticket**: Stores ticket data.
- **LogEntry**: Stores logs generated during the simulation.

## Frontend Setup (Angular)

### Prerequisites
Ensure the following tools are installed on your system:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) for managing Angular projects

### Running the Frontend
1. Navigate to the `frontend/` directory.
2. Install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the Angular development server:
```bash
ng serve
```

4. The frontend will start on [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).

### Connecting the Frontend to the Backend
By default, the frontend is configured to interact with the backend running on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). If the backend runs on a different server or port, update the environment configuration in `environment.ts`:

```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  backendUrl: 'http://localhost:8080'
};
```

### Frontend Features
- **Start Simulation**: Initiate a simulation of ticket production and consumption.
- **View Logs**: View logs for any simulation based on the simulation ID.
- **View All Simulations**: View all past simulations.

## Testing

### Backend Tests
Run unit and integration tests for the backend using Maven:

```bash
mvn test
```

### Frontend Tests
Run unit and end-to-end tests for the frontend using Angular CLI:

```bash
ng test   # For unit tests
ng e2e    # For end-to-end tests
```
